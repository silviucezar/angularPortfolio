Perseverant by nature, I am a self-taught programmer who embarked on this journey 2 years ago, when I began studying JavaScript documentation on my own. Throughout this time, I have consolidated my knowledge both by working on personal projects, but also by creatively putting my new skills to good use at my job at that time, by automation of certain test cases, in order to improve our efficiency as a team.',
